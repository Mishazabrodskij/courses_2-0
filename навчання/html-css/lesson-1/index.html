    Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is a man from Springfield and the protagonist of the animated television
    series The Simpsons.
    He is a crude, ignorant, and slobbish individual, although he is fundamentally a good person and shows great caring
    and loyalty to his family, friends and on occasion, to those he barely knows or those he considers his enemies.

    Well, I wish you wouldn't. Because, aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the
    only father I have. Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my
    adult relationships. So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. And I am far too young to
    defend myself against such onslaughts."
